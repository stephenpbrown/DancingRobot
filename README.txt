Programming Assignment #2: Dancing Robot
Due 10/4/16


Overview:
For this project, I used hierarchical modeling and object instancing in WebGL
in order to make a "dancing" robot. The joint rotations are parameterized so that
the robot takes on different poses. The rotation angles are continually updated
and the robot is re-rendered, causing it to take on different poses, effectively 
"animating" the robot to perform a dance.
